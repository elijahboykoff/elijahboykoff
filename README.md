### Hi! I'm Elijah Boykoff, MS student in Information Science @ CU Boulder.

I find using NLP methods a powerful method of explaining various facets of sociopolitical phenomena. My current research employs embedding techniques to identify patterns in state-level AI legislation and develops a ML model to explain the success of different regulatory approaches to the technology.
